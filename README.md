Face-ID for touch-less recognition or attendance system. 

The project is currently going on, there has been some discrepency in data pairing and linked augmentations.
Other than that the software is to be deployed over the web or on local machine like - Raspberry pi3/4 so that it can be installed in the office or concerned campus.
